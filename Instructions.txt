1. Create laravel new project
2. Create category Model with migration and controller
3. Create post model with migrationc and controller 
4. Add scheema to migration files
5. Create category_post migration (pivot table)
6. Run migrate
7. Create post routes
8. Create view files to show posts
9. We will use bootstrap starter template
10. Create view file to create new post with category
11. Now create some dummy categories with seeder
12. Run db:seed
13. Add jquery select2 plugin

14. Here we see primary key for existing category and Text for new category
15. So we need to save new category first and then take those newly created category's id 
16. As we are inserting data into 2 tables, so its good practice to use DB transaction

17. Now we need to create relationship between category and post
